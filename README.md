# basic_scripts_4_PPI
Here are my basic, basic, BASIC scripts I use for the first steps in running a PPI.

Each file contains the script I use to carry out the first two steps in PPI_myOmy.  

If you notice a better way to script anything, **please**, _**PLEASE**_ tell me. 

Wherever you fare till your eyries receive you at the journey's end!
