# basic_scripts_4_PPI
Here are my basic, basic, BASIC scripts I use for the "PPI_myOmy" repository

Each file contains the script I use to carry out the steps in PPI_myOmy.  
If there is more than one script per step, then they are broken up with Step1a, Step1b, etc, in order necessary to complete the PPI SOP.

If you notice a better way to script anything, **please**, _**PLEASE**_ tell me. 

Wherever you fare till your eyries receive you at the journey's end!
